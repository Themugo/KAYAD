# KAYAD Backend Runtime & Production Deployment Recovery

## Scope

This initiative hardens the production runtime path from GitHub source through Render startup and `/health`, while preserving the existing KAYAD domain architecture. It does not delete feature surfaces merely because an older domain validator expects a different historical architecture.

## Production-critical fixes

- Restored the shared `response` compatibility facade and `created()` HTTP 201 helper.
- Preserved individual response helper exports for existing consumers.
- Preserved authentication compatibility aliases (`requireAuth`, `requireRole`).
- Preserved canonical atomic auction adapters and existing RPC-backed lifecycle.
- Removed the stale Docker `COPY backend/realtime` source that no longer exists.
- Corrected `.dockerignore` so it no longer excludes the backend source from a root-context Docker build.
- Aligned `render.yaml` with the observed production runtime: native Node.js, `backend/` root, deterministic `npm ci --omit=dev`, `npm start`, `/health` health check, and persistent upload path for native Node.
- Kept the Dockerfile valid as a supported alternate deployment path.
- Retained the production frontend runtime hardening: canonical TypeScript Supabase client, explicit production API fallback, and no duplicate `.js` Supabase client.
- Retained deployment-truth verification: Vercel production deployment is required and post-deployment verification is mandatory.

## Additional startup-surface hardening

The first real Render deployment after the environment-secret correction exposed a second class of latent module/runtime defects. These were repaired together rather than serially patching individual Render failures:

- Imported the existing `protectAccount` middleware into `adminRoutes.js`; the middleware already existed and exports the named/default contract.
- Restored the missing `findAll` import used by user-preference statistics.
- Restored the `isSupabaseConnected` dependency used by the auction-reminder startup path.
- Fixed a dead-letter-queue warning to use the queue-local DLQ name instead of an out-of-scope variable.
- Kept `userIds` in scope for the admin chat search/count path.
- Removed unreachable SMS-bidding code after the explicit payment-unavailable return; that block also referenced an undefined `previousHighestBidder`.
- Restored the missing escrow reconciliation result initialization and routed the existing escrow-vault branch through the canonical payment/escrow reconciler.
- Added required model imports to services that referenced their canonical model adapters without importing them.
- Bound the receipt service's `sendEmail` call to the canonical `sendRawEmail` implementation.
- Added a compatibility fallback for notification-worker email delivery.

A repository-wide JavaScript syntax sweep still passes. A production-source static undefined-name sweep found no remaining non-test undefined identifiers after excluding known Node globals and generated SDK template code.

## Verification

- Production backend validation: **27/27 PASS**
- Runtime integrity: **7/7 PASS**
- Deployment readiness: **16/16 PASS**
- Backend runtime contracts: **16/16 PASS**
- Backend JavaScript syntax: **all backend JS/MJS files pass `node --check`**
- Backend HTTP 501 placeholder scan: **0 remaining**
- Local relative module resolution audit: **no unresolved production relative modules detected** (template-string generated SDK imports excluded from runtime import analysis).
- Default-import/default-export audit: **no mismatches detected**.

## Deployment truth

The production frontend is already confirmed live on Vercel. The remaining production blocker observed from Render was a backend ESM startup failure caused by a missing named `response` export. The deployment path must not be considered healthy until `https://api.kayad.space/health` returns a successful health response after the next Render deployment.

## Important validation boundary

The repository contains a large number of historical domain validators. Some older validators still encode superseded architectural expectations in areas such as auction UI convergence, legacy CMS/team surfaces, finance, ownership, and lead CRM. Those failures were not silently converted into passes or used as justification to delete working production code. The production recovery gate above is intentionally limited to runtime, deployment, module-contract, and infrastructure correctness.

## Correction after startup-hardening review

The governance lifecycle hardening migration and end-to-end governance documentation were restored after review. The migration is substantive database hardening and is not redundant with the governance domain creation migration.
