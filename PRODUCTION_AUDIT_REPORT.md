1. **Registered 24 Orphaned Admin Pages** - Added routes for previously unreachable admin pages:
   - `/admin/feedback`, `/admin/broadcast`, `/admin/car-moderation`
   - `/admin/chat-moderation`, `/admin/dealer-verifications`, `/admin/disputes`
   - `/admin/escrow-vault`, `/admin/inspector-applications`, `/admin/market-data`
   - `/admin/ntsa-queue`, `/admin/referrals`, `/admin/reviews`, `/admin/staff`

   - `/admin/operations`, `/admin/operations/control-room`, `/admin/panic`
   - `/admin/webhoist`, `/admin/ads`

2. **Fixed Duplicate Route** - `/gallery` now redirects to `/browse` for canonical URL

3. **Auth Guards** - All routes properly protected with `RequireAuth`, `RequireDealer`, or `RequireAdmin`

### Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx` - Added 24 admin route registrations and redirect

## Phase 2: Component Audit ✅ COMPLETE

### Design System (UI Library)
The application has a comprehensive design system in `src/components/ui/` with 24 components:
- Button, Badge, Card, Drawer, Progress, EmptyState, Avatar, StatCard
- ActivityFeed, Tooltip, Accordion, Segmented, Breadcrumb, Pagination
- PriceTag, FilterChip, RangeSlider, ChartPlaceholder, MapPlaceholder
- BottomNav, Skeleton variants

### New Components Added
1. **Modal.jsx** - Full-featured modal with:
   - Portal rendering, keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
   - Size variants (sm, md, lg, xl, full)
   - Title, footer, close button support
   - Backdrop click handling

2. **Alert.jsx** - Alert component with:
   - 4 variants (info, success, warning, error)
   - Icon support, close button
   - Accessible (role="alert")

3. **Table.jsx** - Sortable table with:
   - Column configuration
   - Loading and empty states
   - Row click handling
   - Pagination-ready structure

### CSS Consolidation
- Consolidated spinner styles (`.spinner` and `.ui-spinner`)
- Added `.spinner-sm` alias for consistency

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/index.js` - Added Modal, Alert, Table exports
- `src/components/ui/Modal.jsx` - NEW
- `src/components/ui/Alert.jsx` - NEW
- `src/components/ui/Table.jsx` - NEW

## Phase 3: Database Audit ✅ COMPLETE

### Schema Analysis
The database uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with 80+ models.

### Indexes Found (14 on cars table alone)
```
- idx_cars_dealer_id, idx_cars_brand, idx_cars_auction_status
- idx_cars_approved, idx_cars_deleted_at, idx_cars_price
- idx_cars_year, idx_cars_body_type, idx_cars_fuel
- idx_cars_location_city, idx_cars_is_promoted
```

### Strengths
- Partial indexes for filtered queries
- Soft delete pattern (`deleted_at`)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Foreign key indexes

### Recommendations
1. Add composite index: `cars(dealer_id, status, approved)`
2. Add composite index: `escrow_transactions(status, created_at)`
3. Verify RLS policies on all tables
4. Add query timeout for expensive operations

---

## Phase 4: Authentication System ✅ COMPLETE

### JWT Authentication
- Token-based authentication with HS256
- Token version for logout invalidation
- 20-second user cache to reduce DB queries

### RBAC (13 Roles)
```
user → individual_seller → dealer → ghost_checker → moderator
→ ad_manager → marketing → escrow_officer → technical_support
→ hr → accounts → admin → superadmin
```

### Permission System
- 15 granular permissions
- Per-user permission grants/revocations
- Webhoist bypass for platform owners

### Security Features
- Ban checking on every authenticated request
- Email verification gate (configurable)
- Account deactivation support
- Rate limiting on auth routes

3. Add API health monitoring widget
4. Create quick actions panel

### Image System
**Current State:**
- LazyImage component exists
- Supabase Storage integration
- WebP/brotli compression in build

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement responsive image srcsets
2. Add blur placeholder (LQIP)
3. Add duplicate detection
4. Implement CDN caching headers

### Search System
**Current State:**
- Basic search with keyword matching
- Saved searches functionality
- Search analytics tracking

**Recommendations:**
1. Add autocomplete/suggestions
2. Add fuzzy matching (typo tolerance)

2. **Test Coverage** - Expand test coverage for critical paths
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Verify Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration

### Medium Priority
1. **Component Migration** - Convert inline styles to UI component library
2. **Error Boundaries** - Add error boundaries to more pages
3. **Accessibility Audit** - Run full WCAG audit

### Low Priority
