## 8. PERFORMANCE CERTIFICATION

### Phase 7: Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **First Paint** | <2s | ~1s | ✅ PASS |
| **Largest Contentful Paint** | <2.5s | ~2s | ✅ PASS |
| **Time to Interactive** | <3s | ~3s | ✅ PASS |
| **Bundle Size** | <500KB | 1.4MB | ❌ FAIL |

| **Search Speed** | <500ms | ~200ms | ✅ PASS |
| **API Latency** | <200ms | ~150ms | ✅ PASS |
| **Memory Usage** | <150MB | ~120MB | ✅ PASS |

### Performance Issues

#### ❌ CRITICAL: Bundle Size (1.4MB)
**Issue**: Main JavaScript bundle exceeds target by 280%

**Root Cause**:
- No code splitting for feature modules
- All features load on initial page load
- Large component libraries

**Impact**: 
- Slow initial load on mobile
- High bandwidth consumption
- Poor performance on 3G

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// Implement lazy loading
const Marketplace = lazy(() => import('./features/Marketplace'));
const Auctions = lazy(() => import('./features/Auctions'));
const Finance = lazy(() => import('./features/Finance'));
```

**Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Risk**: LOW (can be done incrementally)
