## General Third-Party Outage Procedures

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```javascript
// Circuit breaker pattern for external services
const circuitBreaker = {
  failures: 0,
  threshold: 5,
  timeout: 60000, // 1 minute
  state: 'closed',
  
  async execute(serviceCall) {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await serviceCall();
      this.failures = 0;
      this.state = 'closed';
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.failures++;
      if (this.failures >= this.threshold) {
        this.state = 'open';
        setTimeout(() => {
          this.state = 'half-open';
        }, this.timeout);
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
};
```

### Fallback Services
- Identify alternative service providers
- Implement fallback logic
- Test fallback services regularly

### Monitoring
- Monitor third-party service availability
- Monitor API response times
- Monitor error rates
- Set up alerts for failures

## Verification

### Service Health Checks
```bash
# Test M-Pesa connectivity
curl https://api.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa/stkpush/v1/processrequest

# Test Cloudinary connectivity
curl https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<cloud_name>/health

# Test SendGrid connectivity
curl https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/profile

# Test Twilio connectivity
curl https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/<account_sid>
```

### Application Monitoring
- Monitor error rates
- Monitor API response times
- Monitor user complaints
