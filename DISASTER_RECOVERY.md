# Disaster Recovery Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery framework for the KAYAD platform, including recovery objectives, procedures, and runbooks for handling various failure scenarios.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Database**: 15 minutes (max acceptable data loss)
- **Cache**: 0 minutes (cache can be rebuilt from database)
- **Static Assets**: 1 hour (CDN replication)
- **Configuration**: 0 minutes (stored in version control)

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Database**: 1 hour (critical system)
- **Cache**: 5 minutes (non-critical, can operate without)
- **Static Assets**: 30 minutes (CDN failover)
- **Application**: 15 minutes (deployment rollback)

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- **Availability**: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Data Durability**: 99.999% (0.001% data loss)
- **Recovery Success Rate**: 99%

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- **Frequency**: Every 15 minutes (transaction logs), Daily (full backup)
- **Retention**: 7 days daily, 4 weeks weekly, 12 months monthly
- **Storage**: Local + Cloud (S3-compatible)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest and in transit
- **Verification**: Automated integrity checks after each backup

### Current Implementation
- `backend/services/backupService.js` - Backup service
- `backend/scripts/backup.js` - Backup script
- Daily scheduled backups at 2 AM
- 7-day retention policy
- Gzip compression enabled

## Runbooks

### Database Failure Runbook

#### Severity: Critical
#### RTO: 1 hour
#### RPO: 15 minutes

**Symptoms:**
- Application unable to connect to database
- High database connection errors
- Database response timeouts

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check database connectivity
   ```bash
   npm run backup:status
   ```
2. Verify database service status
3. Check database logs for errors
4. Alert on-call database administrator

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **If database is down:**
   - Restart database service
   - Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **If database is corrupted:**
   - Identify corruption extent
   - Restore from latest verified backup
   - Apply transaction logs for point-in-time recovery
   - Verify data integrity

3. **If primary database fails:**
   - Promote standby database (if available)
   - Update application connection string
   - Verify failover success

**Verification:**
- Run health check endpoint
- Verify critical queries work
- Check data consistency
- Monitor for 30 minutes

**Escalation:**
- If unresolved in 15 minutes: Alert senior DBA
- If unresolved in 30 minutes: Alert CTO
- If unresolved in 1 hour: Declare incident

### Cache Failure Runbook

#### Severity: Medium
#### RTO: 5 minutes
#### RPO: 0 minutes

**Symptoms:**
- Increased database load
- Slower API response times
- Cache-related errors

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check Redis connectivity
2. Verify Redis service status
3. Monitor cache hit rates

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **If Redis is down:**
   - Restart Redis service
   - Check memory usage
   - Verify configuration

2. **If Redis is corrupted:**
   - Flush cache (data will be rebuilt)
   - Restart Redis service
   - Monitor cache warmup

3. **If Redis is unavailable:**
   - Application will use in-memory fallback (already implemented)
   - Monitor database load increase
   - Restore Redis service when available

**Verification:**
- Check cache hit rates return to normal
- Monitor API response times
- Verify database load decreases

**Note:** Cache failure is non-critical. Application can operate with in-memory fallback.

### Third-Party Outage Runbook

#### Severity: Variable (depends on service)
#### RTO: Variable
#### RPO: N/A

**Third-Party Services:**
- M-Pesa (payments)
- Cloudinary (images)
- SendGrid (emails)
- Twilio (SMS)
- Sentry (error tracking)

**M-Pesa Outage (Critical):**
1. Enable maintenance mode for payment features
2. Display outage notice to users
3. Queue pending payments
4. Monitor M-Pesa status
5. Process queued payments when service restored

**Cloudinary Outage (Medium):**
1. Serve images from CDN cache
2. Display placeholder images if cache miss
3. Monitor Cloudinary status
4. Re-upload images if needed after restoration

**SendGrid/Twilio Outage (Low):**
1. Queue notifications
2. Retry with exponential backoff
3. Log failed deliveries
4. Process when service restored

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Monitor third-party status pages
2. Implement circuit breakers for external calls
3. Use fallback services if available
4. Process queued operations after restoration

**Verification:**
- Test third-party connectivity
- Process queued operations
- Verify no data loss

### Deployment Rollback Runbook

#### Severity: Critical
#### RTO: 15 minutes
#### RPO: 0 minutes

**Symptoms:**
- Increased error rates after deployment
- Performance degradation
- Feature failures
- User complaints

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Stop deployment if in progress
2. Monitor error rates
3. Check application logs
4. Alert on-call engineer

**Rollback Steps:**
1. **Automatic Rollback:**
   - If error rate > 5%, trigger automatic rollback
   - Revert to previous stable version
   - Verify rollback success

2. **Manual Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Identify previous stable commit
   git log --oneline -10
   
   # Rollback to previous version
   git checkout <previous-stable-commit>
   
   # Redeploy
   npm run build
   # Deploy to production
   ```

3. **Database Rollback (if needed):**
   - Restore pre-deployment database backup
   - Run migration rollback scripts
   - Verify data integrity

**Verification:**
- Check error rates return to normal
- Verify critical features work
- Monitor performance metrics
- Run smoke tests

**Post-Mortem:**
- Document root cause
- Update deployment procedures
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Review rollback effectiveness

## Failover Procedures
